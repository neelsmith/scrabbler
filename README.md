Command-line scripts in scala for playing with word fragments and word lists.

This is derived from Tess Starshak's work analyzing fragmentary texts preserved in the floor tiles from Chertsey Abbey: see [her discussion](https://github.com/tessstarshak/portfolio/wiki).


## Requirements

- [scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/)

## Examples in the `data` directory

The file `crusaderWordList.txt` has word lists from two Crusader chronicles:

- Richard of Devizes' *Chronicles of Richard I* (dated 1192)
- William of Tyre's *A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea* (dated between 1170 and 1184)

The file `fragments.txt` is a hand-typed list of strings for testing the scripts in the `scripts` directory.
